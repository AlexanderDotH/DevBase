[00:25.84] A beacon shining a light
[00:28.44] And guiding us through the darkest night
[00:31.97] We all need a hero
[00:35.06] Breaking down the walls
[00:38.20] Someone who can bite the bullets in the night
[00:41.98] So we make it 'til the dawn
[00:44.63] We all need a hero
[00:47.87] Bigger than us all
[00:51.10] Someone who can make us stronger for the fight
[00:54.67] So that we can win the war
[00:57.36]
