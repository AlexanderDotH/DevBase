[00:14.96] He keeps me guessing on my toes
[00:17.36] Leaves me hungry, wantin' more
[00:19.96] And I love the rush (ah-ah)
[00:23.18] Always unpredictable
[00:25.03] But there's one thing that I know
[00:27.63] That our love is trash

[00:33.69] Now my days are numbered
[00:35.94] 'Til I lose my mind
[00:37.51] Falling for a robber, he's stealin' all my time
[00:41.43] I can smell the danger, the danger
[00:44.83] But he don't scare me
[00:46.71] 
[00:59.79] (He don't scare me)
