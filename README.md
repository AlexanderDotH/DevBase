## DevBase.Api

DevBase.Api contains API endpoint implementations for Deezer, OpenAI, OpenLyricsClient, Replicate, and Tidal. The library provides partial implementations that are tailored to meet the needs of the current project.

## DevBase.Avalonia

DevBase.Avalonia features a color calculator for images. The calculator helps determine dominant and accent colors within an image, making it easier to create visually appealing and harmonious designs.

## DevBase.Cryptography and DevBase.Cryptography.BouncyCastle

The DevBase.Cryptography and DevBase.Cryptography.BouncyCastle libraries offer a collection of cryptographic implementations for various use cases. They provide a wide range of cryptographic algorithms and tools, including encryption, decryption, hashing, and digital signatures.

## DevBase.Format

DevBase.Format contains parsers for the following file formats:

- **.env**: Environment files used to store configuration variables for applications, typically key-value pairs.
- **.lrc**: Lyric files used to store song lyrics and timestamps, allowing for synchronization between lyrics and audio playback.
- **.srt**: SubRip Text files used to store subtitles and their associated timestamps for video playback.

## DevBase.Logging

DevBase.Logging is a lightweight logger that makes it easy to log and debug your application. It offers a simple interface for logging messages, errors, and other information at various levels of granularity.
